Browser Detection
-----------------

*Browser.js* in *Browser* includes a browser detection variables added to the `Browser` object. For the most part, MooTools smooths over the differences between browsers and you shouldn't find yourself needing to reference these variables very often. However, there are times when you need to know, and MooTools provides.

There's not a lot to describe here other than these things exist and you can use them in your code. For exampe, let's say you wanted to work around some IE6 bug:

	if (Browser.ie6) //...do something for IE6
	else if (Browser.ie) //...do something for all other version of IE
	else //...everyone else gets some standard behavior

You can find all the `Browser` properties (in the docs)[http://mootools.net/docs/core/Browser/Browser].

### Feature detection

Knowing wich browser the current user uses is great, but knowing what the browser of the user is actually capable of is even better. Especially when User Agent sniffing is not always accurate. MooTools uses this technique at all possible places instead of using the `Browser` object. It's encouraged you'd do that too. There are several libraries under which Modernizr or Has.js where you could grab those tests from or have a look into the MooTools source.
